Work in progress to get the 'central' lattitude and longitute of each country,
and the extremes (either most northerly or most southerly, depending on hemisphere).

It's currently getting this data from some fusion tables, and checking using google
maps it seems to be working, but it isn't quite there yet, a couple of things left
to do.

Also needs a client_secrets.json, which is the google api thing for proving you're a
person who's allowed to do this sort or thing.  Obviously not putting mine on github.
